//////////// Building an Object ////////////

// First, create an object called words with the keys given below. Each key's property should be an empty string. This is where we will save the user's input later.
// The keys: number, adjective, plural noun (pluralNoun), adverb, another adjective (anotherAdjective)

const words = {
    number: "",
    adjective: "",
    pluralNoun: "",
    adverb: "",
    anotherAdjective: "",
}

//////////// Interact With the User ////////////

/* Start by creating a function called startMadlib that prompts a user to enter each word type and save their input to the appropriate object key. 
For example, the following prompt's user input should be saved to the number key in our words object: */

const startMadlib = (prompt) => {
    
}
